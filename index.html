        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
           Hello, my name is Chris and I'm a Software Engineer working for Revature. My background
           is in Data Science; in which I have a B.S. from George Mason University. This degree has
           coupled nicely with back-end development, giving me a strong foundation in problem-solving,
           data management, and logical thinking. I am eager to continue growing as a developer, building
           reliable systems, and contributing to impactful projects.

                <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherBucsa/ChristopherBucsa-pep-project">Social Media Blog API</a>
                <p>
                    Primary technologies utilized: Java, Javalin, JDBC
                    This project is a backend implementation for a hypothetical social media app, handling user
                    authentication and leveraging CRUD operations for message management and efficient data
                    retrieval. 
                <p>

            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherBucsa/ChristopherBucsa-pep-spring-project">Spring Social Media Blog API</a>
                <p>Primary technologies utilized: Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Framework<p>
                    <p>
                        This iteration of the social media app leverages the Spring framework to build a scalable backend. It
                        implements user authentication, RESTful APIs for account and message management, and efficient data 
                        retrieval using Spring Web, ensuring maintainability and security.
