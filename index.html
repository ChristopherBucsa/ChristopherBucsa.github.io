        <p>
            Hello, my name is Chris and I'm a Software Engineer working for Revature. My background
           is in Data Science; in which I have a B.S. from George Mason University. This degree
           couples nicely with back-end development, giving me a strong foundation in problem-solving,
           data management, and logical thinking. I am eager to continue growing as a developer, building
           reliable systems, and contributing to impactful projects.
