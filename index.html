        <p>
           Hello, my name is Chris and I'm a Software Engineer working for Revature. My background
           is in Data Science; in which I have a B.S. from George Mason University. This degree has
           coupled nicely with back-end development, giving me a strong foundation in problem-solving,
           data management, and logical thinking. I am eager to continue growing as a developer, building
           reliable systems, and contributing to impactful projects.

                <p>In this project, I developed the backend of a social media application, focusing on managing
                   user accounts and messages. I gained hands-on experience with user authentication (logins and registrations)
                   and implemented CRUD operations for managing messages; including creation, updates, and deletions. I also worked
                   on designing a backend that efficiently retrieves messages, whether all messages or just those from a particular
                   user. Primary technologies utilized: Java, Javalin, JDBC.
